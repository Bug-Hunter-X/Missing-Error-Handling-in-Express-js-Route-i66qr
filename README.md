# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the absence of proper error handling. The code fetches user data from a database, but it fails to handle potential errors, such as database connection issues or the user not existing.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that retrieves user data by ID.  It uses a hypothetical `db.getUser` function, which might throw errors. However, the code does not catch or handle these errors, leading to the server potentially crashing or returning an internal server error to clients.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route, including comprehensive error handling.  It checks for errors returned by `db.getUser` and sends appropriate HTTP error responses to the client, along with user-friendly error messages.
